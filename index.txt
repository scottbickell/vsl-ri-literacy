Help Your Struggling Readers Conquer Reading Challenges

Dear %%first_name%%,

Good news! The state of Rhode Island has been awarded a $20 million grant to improve literacy. The five-year Comprehensive Literacy State Development grant is designed to support communities by strengthening literacy development and instruction. Teachers who understand the science of reading and have access to materials that follow the Structured Literacy approach can help struggling students find literacy success, even those with dyslexia or other reading disorders.

Learn how our programs, which follow the principles of Structured Literacy, give teachers the support they need to help every student become a proficient reader.
